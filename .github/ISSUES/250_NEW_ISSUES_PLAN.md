## 📁 File Naming Convention

All new issues will create files in:
```
exercises/1000_programs/<level>/<descriptive_name>.py
```

Where:
- `<level>` = beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert
- `<descriptive_name>` = snake_case descriptive name

**Examples:**
- `exercises/1000_programs/beginner/greeting_card_generator.py`
- `exercises/1000_programs/intermediate/password_manager_encryption.py`
- `exercises/1000_programs/advanced/rest_api_flask.py`
- `exercises/1000_programs/expert/distributed_task_queue.py`
