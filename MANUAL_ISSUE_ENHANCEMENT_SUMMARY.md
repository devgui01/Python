# 📚 Manual Issue Documentation Enhancement

**Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ **In Progress - Manual Enhancement**

---

## 🎯 What We're Doing

Manually enhancing **each GitHub issue** with:
1. **Detailed problem explanation** - What the problem actually IS
2. **Deep concept understanding** - Why it matters, key concepts
3. **Multiple solution approaches** - Different ways to solve
4. **Comprehensive test cases** - Edge cases, normal cases
5. **Learning resources** - Links to understand concepts
6. **Common Q&A** - Anticipating contributor questions

## ✅ Example: Issue #1822 Enhanced

### Before (Generic):
```
Program 905: Sort Array By Parity
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Array
Task: Sort array with even numbers first
```

### After (Detailed):
```
## 🎯 What This Problem Is About

**Problem Statement:**
Given an integer array `nums`, move all even integers to the beginning 
followed by all odd integers.

**Real-World Analogy:**
Think of sorting laundry - separate white clothes (even) from colored 
clothes (odd), putting whites first.

**Example:**
Input: [3, 1, 2, 4]
Output: [2, 4, 3, 1]  # evens first, then odds

## 🧠 Deep Understanding

**Key Concepts:**
1. Parity - even vs odd numbers
2. Two-Pointer Technique - efficient partitioning
3. In-place vs Extra Space tradeoffs
4. Array partitioning (QuickSort foundation)

**Why This Matters:**
- Common interview question
- Foundation for QuickSort partitioning
- Teaches two-pointer technique
- Multiple solution approaches possible

## 🎓 Three Approaches Provided

1. **Two Lists** - Simple, O(n) space
2. **Two Pointers** - Optimal, O(1) space
3. **Sort with Key** - One-liner, O(n log n)

## 🧪 9 Test Cases Included

- Basic case
- Single element
- All even / All odd
- Empty list
- Negative numbers
- With zero
- etc.

## ❓ Common Q&A

Q: Does order matter?
A: No, just evens before odds

Q: In-place or new array?
A: Either, document your choice
```
